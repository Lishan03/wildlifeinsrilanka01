    "introdtopic1" : "WILDLIFE PARKS IN SRI LANKA",
    "introdpara1" : "Sri Lanka has a history of nature conservation and it’s believed that Sri Lanka’s first national park was established between 377 BC and 1017AD, most likely around the 3rd century AD. Most of Sri Lanka’s current national parks date back to colonial times or even earlier in Sri Lanka’s history. Sri Lanka’s national parks are governed by the 1937 Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and can also only be created, abolished or changed by ministerial order from the government. The first two official national parks in Sri Lanka are Yala and Wilpattu National Parks. Both were established on February the 25th 1938. All 26 of the Sri Lankan national parks cover a variety of different geography and habitats, from mountainous montane forest to Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests, grasslands, and wetland lagoons. Sri Lanka has a vast array of untouched natural habitats for you to enjoy. The biological diversity that this small island encompasses is huge. Sri Lanka has an incredible amount of endemism of both flora and fauna. Specifically, 16% of fauna and 23% of flora are endemic to the country, making Sri Lanka even more unique than you could possibly imagine.",

    "introdpara4" : "One of the most beautiful World Heritage Sites in the world is definitely the Horton Plains National Park in Sri Lanka. The park is spread over the two highest mountains in the area called Kirigalpotta and Totapola. The plateau-like structure along with plains on one end, thick forests and mountains on other make the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. You will find a number of waterfalls, lakes, rocky hills and views of the ocean in this part of the country. The forest is home to a number of wild animals and birds, however, most large animals remain elusive and unapproachable.",
